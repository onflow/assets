# dApp Assets

This directory contains logo assets for decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Flow blockchain.

## Directory Structure

Each dApp should have its own folder, with logo files placed in format-specific subfolders:

```bash
dappname/png/logo.png
dappname/svg/logo.svg
```

-   `svg/` - SVG format dApp logos
-   `png/` - PNG format dApp logos (256x256px recommended)

## Naming Convention

Use simple, non-descriptive filenames for logos and ensure the logo is in the right folder:

`logo.svg`
`logo.png`

## Adding a New dApp

1. Prepare both SVG and PNG versions of the dApp logo if possible
2. The PNG should be 256x256 pixels with a transparent background
3. Name the files as `logo.svg` and `logo.png`
4. Place the files in their respective dapp folder
5. Ensure you have the rights to submit the logo
